# Hacker News

This application allows you to know the last tech news, thanks to [Hacker News](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) service [Try it here!](//link al sito)

## Minimal Design

I chose this design because it's user friendly, with a simple grid of news that shows the title, the date an a link to the original news.
